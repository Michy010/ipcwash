    Ipcwash was established in 2020 and it was known as WASH club not until 2022 when it was renamed to IPCWASH as per
    expansion of clubâ€™s scope. On 2021, the club participated in various health education activities in collaboration
    with partners like SOHIC-muhas.

    medical students association at MUHAS ie TAMSA in a project named <b>Afya yangu project</b> which dealt more with sexual
